# auto_search_in_browser

<h4> The main intention of developing this repositry is to find a hack to crack the microsost rewards program in less time.</h4>


<h3>Pre-requisites for running the program:</h3>
Before executing the program, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

Install the pyautogui library using pip.
Install the faker library using pip.
Adjust the window size of the program to a smaller dimension, while maximizing the size of the Microsoft Edge browser window for correct pointing of the cursor.
Ensure the pyautogui.click(x=500, y=50) coordinates in the code are adjusted to point specifically to the search bar within the Microsoft Edge browser, rather than a search engine's search bar (e.g., Google or Yahoo).
